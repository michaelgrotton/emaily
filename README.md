You can demo the application by logging in with your google account, buying credits with the fake credit card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 (name, cvv, and exp date do not matter), and creating a survey to send via email to customers (send to yourself for this demo), to which they (you) can respond and you can see the response on the dashboard.
